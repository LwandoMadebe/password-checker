## 🔐 Password Strength Checker

A simple Python script that evaluates password strength based on length, character variety, and entropy. It helps users create stronger passwords by providing instant feedback. 🚀

### 📌 Features
✅ Checks password length  
✅ Detects uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters  
✅ Uses entropy-based strength analysis (via `zxcvbn`)  
✅ Provides instant feedback on password strength  

#### 🛠 Installation
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LwandoMadebe/password-checker.git
   cd password-checker
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install zxcvbn
### 📌 To-Do (Future Enhancements)
1. Check if the password has been leaked (using Have I Been Pwned API)
